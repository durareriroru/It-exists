# Presentation: the short ~~and sweet~~

![First slide is a simple black text on white background reading Top 3 Design Stuff I Found on My notebook](img/presebtace-1.png)
![Second slide shows the first design. It's a showcase of playing cards with diamons as the central motif. The diamonds have cool toned palette, made of blues and purples. The colouring of the diamons is flat.](img/presebtace-2.png)
![The third slide shows a poster of a custom-made alphabet. The font is designed to resemble human hands, severed just below the wrist, with the letters formed by bending the fingers into mostly unnatural angles. The hands are arranged on a checker-patterned background, like pieces on a chessboard—except for the letters M and N, which sit in the corners of the third row. At the centre is the name of the font, UNCLEAR GESTURES. One alternative name considered was Fear Garden, inspired by the song sharing the same name.](img/presebtace-3.png)
![The third slide shows a Japanese character for spring (春, haru), made to resemble a cherry blossom tree that blooms during the season, painted with watercolours. The character is written in dark brown to mimic a tree trunk from which pink leaves, shaped like clouds, sprout from the top of the tree, leaning to the right. The whole composition is set in a void, shifting from pink at the top to light blue at the bottom gradient background. There were 3 more drawings in the series, but they were lost in the dusts of my room.](img/presebtace-4.png)
![The forth and final slide is handwriten black text on a white background reading THX for suffering](img/presebtace-5.png)
