#### Sleeve 1
Hi!! I’m Eva. There’s always an idea, but often it gets lost in translation—and I intend to change that. With design. There’s no better feeling than knowing where you’re going, so hop into my inbox and let’s see where we end up.

If design is what you’re searching for, then you’re in luck! Hey, I’m Eva. I designer that can never sit still before jumping from one project to another. Others call it chaos, but I call them boring. If you need a logo, a product, a website, a cover for your book or band, motion or even *gasp* an animation, I’m be ready and waiting for you to reach out! Don’t be a stranger~
