# One image says a couple of words

There's not much to yap about, here's the result:

![A bespoke character made out of a pancake, shaped into a capital letter P. Beside the character is placed a small wall of text of words stating with letter p, where the author attempts to create a rhythm? The font used for the text is Andulka.](imgg/pancak.png)
At first, it was meant to be just a wall of words starting with *p*, but the first six, when I read them [in my head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49tyOkJ0uLs&list=RD49tyOkJ0uLs&start_radio=1), sounded a bit like a poem but written by an amateur and a dumbass. Hey, hi, hello lol

![A pattern made out of copies of a single pancake that is shaped into a capital letter P. The copies are turned into various angles and placed beside eachother in order to create the pattern.](imgg/pancak-2.png)
I know the first image was meant as like a header image in alt-text channel, but the second one was nicer :3

![A bespoke character made out of a pancake, shaped into a capital letter P. Beside the character is placed an intentionally misspelled word reading pancak with wide spaces between each letter.](imgg/pancak-3.png)
You know what you see, no comments here.
